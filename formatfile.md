## Task
I daily work with signed xml files.
The files contain unrecognised characters due to signing.
This script is to format the files in such a way that I get only the xml parts.

### Usage:
##### From Linux:
`bash formatfile.sh filename`

##### From Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux:
`wsl.exe cd /mnt/path-to-location; /bin/bash formatfile.sh`
This is inprogress. To send the filename parameter to wsl.
